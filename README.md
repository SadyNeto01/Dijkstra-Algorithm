# Dijkstra Algorithm
 Created a Dijakstra Algorithm to solve a problem presented by my teacher 

Thi Java program implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted, undirected graph. The code takes user inputs for the number of vertices, edges, and edge descriptions, then computes the shortest paths between specified starting and ending vertices. The program provides two perspectives on the shortest path: one in terms of the count of edges and the other in terms of the sum of edge weights. The main functionalities are encapsulated within well-organized methods, and the code structure is designed for clarity and readability. Users can interactively input graph details or construct a graph from a file, making it versatile for various use cases involving graph traversal and pathfinding.
